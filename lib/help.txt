TE-discovery script help

You can run this script with different parameters. To call up this help page use: 
perl mainscript.pl -h

REQUIRED OF ALL ANALYSES
All other analyses but help will requires at that at least these parameters are set:
    -n folder name (full path) to store analysis files
    -e folder name (full path) to store elements

SPECIFY STEPS TO EXECUTE
Unless you specify otherwise all the analysis steps will be executed. To specify that just one or a range
of consecutive steps be executed set the parameter(s):
    -a number of first (or only) step to execute
    -b number of last step to execute, if not specified then only the first step will be excuted

STEP1 PARAMETERS 
The input file(s) for this step can be either a fasta file of proteins and an associated genome file, or a tblastn output file.
The tblastn option is so this time consuming step can be run on a faster machine on its own, the tblastn output must be formated in the
same way as shown in the script

    IF PROTEINS ARE USED AS INPUT 
    -p fasta file of proteins that could be part of a TE 
    -g fasta file of the genome associated with the proteins; this file must have been formated with "makeblastdb" ahead of time

    IF tBLASTN IS USED AS INPUT 
    -t tblastn output in the same format used in the script
